# Theme not found

My submission to [2020 js13k game jam](http://2020.js13kgames.com/) with theme *404 (Not found)*.

The theme cannot be found, you must find the theme. Use letters and/or your keyboard to guess a letter in a theme. Reveal all letters to advance to the next theme.

This should work properly on mobile, but it's really meant for wide screens.

Made with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/3.7.0/manual/overview)
